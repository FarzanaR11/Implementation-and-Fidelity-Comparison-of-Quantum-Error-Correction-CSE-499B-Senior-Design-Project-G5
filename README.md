Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC), quantum information is protected against errors caused by decoherence and noise in Quantum Computers. Through the use of qubit redundancy, QEC focuses on error-correcting codes to increase the reliability of quantum systems. In this project, we adopt a practical methodology and employ Quantum Repetition Code as a scalable approach which is one of the easiest ways to prevent and correct classical channel bit-flip errors. Instead of using a physical qubit ∣ ψ⟩ = α ∣ 0⟩ + β ∣ 1⟩, we encode a logical qubit using three physical qubits as ∣ ψ⟩ = α ∣ 000⟩ + β ∣ 111⟩. We’ve used this method on 3, 5 quantum error correcting codes to compare their fidelities to reduce bit flip errors at the best possible state.
